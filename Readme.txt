This is a dummy react project that can be used as a starting point for new react projects. It uses react, react-router, webpack, babel, ES6, express server and webpack dev server.

Instructions:

If yoou are on the mac(or linux), rename "package_mac.json" to "package.json", if you are on windows, rename "package_windows.json" to "package.json". Run "npm install" in terminal from your project folder, then "npm start". Go to "localhost:8080" in the browser. Each time you save a file, the browser will rerfesh automatically.

There is an option to choose between a production and a development server by setting an evironment variable NODE_ENV. On windows, "set NODE_ENV=production", and then "npm start". To change back, "set NODE_ENV=development". On linux/mac, run "NODE_ENV=production npm start" or "NODE_ENV=development npm start".
